<P>Skins are pre-produced visual schemes that can be applied to the user interface portion of a program. UNICON Academus makes use of skins to change the colors, fonts, graphics, and general layout of the application to provide the end user with several appealing choices. When someone changes skins on their layout, it only affects them. This does not affect people who log in through other user accounts.</P>
