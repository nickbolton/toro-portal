<STRONG>View All Active Offerings : Managing Offerings</STRONG>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>Offering States</SPAN><BR></STRONG></P>
<P>There are two types of <B>Offerings</B>, active and inactive. When an Offering is created, it is considered <B>Active</B>. When an <B>Active</B> Offering is deleted, its status becomes <B>Inactive</B>. Most people cannot view <B>Inactive</B> Offerings. This is a tidy way of storing unused Offerings for future use, without them cluttering up the Active Offerings list. This feature also allows sponsors to continue to have access to an offering after the conclusion of a term, while removing the offering from the students' or members' view.</P>
