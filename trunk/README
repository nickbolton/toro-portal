Creating a release candidate

From the root directory,
* run release-management/create-release-candidate

Cutting a release
* Make sure the project has been promoted to a release candidate
* run release-management/cut-release


Sometimes the mvn release:perform step will fail due to the checkout failing.  If this happens, just run the following:
* cd target
* svn --non-interactive checkout https://toro-portal.googlecode.com/svn/tags/toro-portal-<version> checkout (replacing <version> with the proper version)
* cd checkout
* mvn deploy
