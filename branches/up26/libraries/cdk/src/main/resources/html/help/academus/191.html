<P>This channel allows you to add, edit, or delete all topics. Examples of <B>Topics</B> can range from courses to clubs to departments at your institution. <B>Offerings</B>, on the other hand, are specific sub-groups of Topics. An Offering can be a specific class section of a course, a specific group within a club, or a campus department that reports to a higher department. So when you add a new Topic, you're setting the foundation under which many Offerings can be created.</P>
