<P><SPAN class=contenttitle></SPAN>Preferences enable you to create or modify your Personal Composite View(s). The Personalized Composite View is a user-defined list of personal and shared calendars. By choosing a variety of calendars to show within this view, the user can control the events that "roll-up" and are viewed. </P>
<P>Click the <B>Add Composite View Configuration</B> icon to create a new composite calendar. Enter the name for the new composite view (e.g. My Clubs, Classes). Check the boxes corresponding to those calendars from which events should be displayed in your composite view. Click the <B>Save </B>button to save your latest selections.</P>
<P>Users can also choose to hide any shared calendars by checking the corresponding box next to the calendar they wish to hide, then clicking the <B>Save</B> button. Hiding a shared calendar means that that calendar will no longer appear in any drop-down lists within the calendar channels.</P>
