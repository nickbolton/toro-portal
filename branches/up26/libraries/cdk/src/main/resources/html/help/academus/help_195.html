<P>The Folder view allows the user to create, edit, and manipulate file folders. The system contains various default file folders (e.g., in-box, drafts, sent mail, trash). In addition, the user can setup a variety of other folders that can be used to categorize their e-mail messages.</P>
<P>The folder view will display all of the folders and the number of read and unread messages they contain. By clicking on a folder, you will be brought into a focused folder view of the e-mail messages within that folder (similar to the in-box view).</P>
<P>You can check the amount of space utilized within each folder by clicking the <B>Check Folder Sizes </B>link. This will open up an additional column that shows the size of each folder.</P>
<P>You can add new folders by clicking the <B>Add Folder</B> button. The system will prompt you for the folder name. After entering this information, the new folder will be created and ready for use. You can rename any "user-created" folder by clicking the <B>Edit</B> icon within the folder row.</P>
<P>Finally, you can delete folder(s) by selecting the check-box to the left of the folder name, and clicking the <B>Delete</B> button. By deleting a folder, you will delete the folder and all of its contents (other folders and e-mail messages). Deleted e-mail messages will appear under the "trash" folder until the <B>Empty Trash</B> link has been selected.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
