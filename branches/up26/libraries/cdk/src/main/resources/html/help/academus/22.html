<STRONG>Exporting the Gradebook</STRONG>

<P>The time may come when you want to export the Gradebook from Academus into an external program (such as a spreadsheet). Academus can help you export the gradebook information into a pipe-delimited text file. This means that every cell within the table will be separated by the pipe "|" character. Each row will be separated by a carriage return. </P>
<P>If you would like to export the gradebook in this manner, simply follow these steps:</P>

<OL type=1>
<LI>Locate the <B>Gradebook</B> channel and click the <B>Export</B> icon at the top of the channel next to the <B>Scores</B> link. </LI>
<LI>A new window will open, showing the name of the export text file. You will also be prompted to save this file on your computer. </LI>
<LI>Select a location on your computer and save the file. </LI>
<LI>Once you save it, the new window will close itself. </LI>
<LI>You now have the gradebook in .txt format. </LI>
<LI>Follow the instructions within any external program (such as Excel) for importing a text file. Remember that this table is "pipe-delimited."</LI></OL>
