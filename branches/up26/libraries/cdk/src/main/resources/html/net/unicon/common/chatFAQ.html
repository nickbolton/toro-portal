         <h3>Why do I get just an empty window when trying to launch the chat client?</h3>
  <p>The chat client requires that the browser used to access ACADEMUS&trade; has a version of the Java&trade; Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.</p>
  <br />
  <hr />
  <h3>How does one obtain a version of the JRE?</h3>
  <p><a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp" title="To download a JRE version from Sun">Download</a> and install a version of the Java&trade; Runtime Environment (JRE) from Sun Microsystems.</p>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The chat client has been tested and found to work with the following JRE versions: 1.3.1, 1.4.2, and 1.5.0.  Other versions may also work but if trouble persists, please try installing one of these versions.</p>
