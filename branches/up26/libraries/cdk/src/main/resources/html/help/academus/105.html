<SPAN class=contenttitle><STRONG>Archiving Messages</STRONG></SPAN><BR>
<P>Occasionally, the Forums channel may become cluttered with out-of-date and/or inappropriate messages. In this case, archiving is the best option. The <B>Archive</B> feature will temporarily remove an entire thread (including the first message and all subsequent replies) from the channel. This is not a permanent deletion; archived messages can be recovered. </P>
<P>To archive a thread, follow these steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Select the Topic for which threads will be archived. </LI>
<LI>Click the <B>Archive</B> icon button at the bottom of the channel. </LI>
<LI>Check the box next to the message thread(s) that should be archived. </LI>
<LI>Click the <B>OK</B> button. </LI>
<LI>The thread(s) are no longer visible to any users on the main Forum view for that topic.</LI></OL>
<P>To "unarchive" a message thread, simply follow the same steps above and uncheck any threads that need to be recovered. If a thread is checked, it is archived. If it is unchecked, it is visible.</P>

<P align=left><SPAN class=contenttitle><STRONG>Searching the Forums</STRONG></SPAN><BR></P>
<P>The Forums Channel may eventually become highly populated with messages. In this event, the <B>Search</B> feature will come in handy. This feature allows searches on text within a message, within the subject, or on attachment files. Message searches can be refined to locate posts from within a specific topic, by a specific author, or by posting dates. </P>
<P>To conduct a search, follow these steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>From the main Forum view, click the <B>Search</B> button at the top of the channel. </LI>
<LI>Enter the text to find in the <B>Find</B> field. </LI>
<LI>Check the boxes where the search should take place: <B>Subject</B>, <B>Body</B>, and/or <B>Attachments.</B> </LI>
<LI>Decide which Topic(s) to include in the search. Choose either <B>All</B> topics, or pick a specific one. </LI>
<LI>If the message Author is known, enter that in the <B>Author</B> field to help refine the search. </LI>
<LI>Enter dates in the <B>From</B> and <B>To</B> fields to search during a specific time period. Note that the required date format is <B>mm/dd/yyyy</B>. </LI>
<LI>Click the <B>Search</B> button to begin the search. </LI>
<LI>Results will appear beneath the search section. If you desire more or fewer results, refine your search accordingly and click the <B>Search</B> button again. Once you've found the message, click on its title to view it.</LI></OL>

<P>The <B>Preferences</B> link allows users to change the presentation of posts within the Forums Channel. On the Preferences screen, users can choose, whether message content should be viewed in a new screen or within the same screen</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="screenshots/forums_channel_8.GIF"></P>
<P>If the preference to go to a new screen to view message content is not selected, the forum presentation will appear as in the screenshot below. Allowing the user to view both the contents of an individual post and the hierarchical message tree.</P>
