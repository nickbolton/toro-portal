<STRONG>The Offering Calendar</STRONG>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Calendar channel located within the Groupware Tab is a calendar dedicated to the specific offering. The current offering is always highlighted in the Navigation Channel. This channel is for offering sponsors to list important events for users within the offering. Users generally cannot add or edit events in this calendar; however, they can link to these events from within their own personal calendar channel outside the Collaborative Groupware.</P>
<P>The default view displays the current month, which allows the user to navigate between months or to a particular date. Selecting a date opens the event view for that date from which the user can view events, add/edit or delete events (if permissions apply). The left side of the channel shows the current month. To view a different month, use the arrow icon next to the month navigate to previous or future months.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="screenshots/calendar_channel_3.gif"></P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=contenttitle><STRONG>Detailed Month View</STRONG></SPAN><BR></P>
<P>To display the focused version of the monthly calendar, click the Month tab within the calendar channel. </P>
<P>This will display a focused view of the selected month. To navigate to future or previous months, you may use the arrow icons next to the month currently being displayed. To navigate directly to a specific month select the desired month and year from the drop down boxes and click <B>Go</B>.</P>
<P>Users who have the appropriate permissions to add events can do so by clicking the <B>Add</B> icon for any specific day. If no permissions are available, the Add icon will not appear.</P>
<P>All users can get a focused view of a specific day by clicking the date. If any events have been created, users can view those events by clicking the event title.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="screenshots/calendar_channel_4.gif"></P>
<P align=left><STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>Detailed Week View</SPAN><BR></STRONG></P>
<P>To display a focused view that details a specific "weekly" view of the calendar, click the<B> Week</B> tab within the calendar channel. </P>
<P>To navigate to future or previous weeks, you may use the arrow icons next to the week currently being displayed. </P>
<P>Users who have the appropriate permissions to add events can do so by clicking the <B>Add </B>icon for any specific day. If no permissions are available, the <B>Add</B> icon will not appear (as in the screenshot below)</P>
<P>All users can get a focused view of a specific day by clicking the desired date. If any events have been created, users can view those events by clicking the event title.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="screenshots/calendar_channel_5.gif"></P>
<P align=left><STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>Detailed Day View</SPAN><BR></STRONG></P>
<P>Clicking on any of the dates in the small monthly calendar will bring up a "daily" view with specific hour-by-hour information for that date. Users can access this daily view in two additional ways, by clicking on any specific date from within the focused monthly view, or by clicking on any specific date from within the focused weekly view (both views were described in the previous sections of this lesson.)</P>
<P>Users who have the appropriate permissions can add events by clicking on the <B>Add</B> icon for a specific hour. If any events are listed on this day, they can be viewed and/or edited by clicking on the <B>Event Title</B>, or they can be deleted by clicking on the <B>Delete </B>icon. If no permissions are available, these icon will not appear.</P>
