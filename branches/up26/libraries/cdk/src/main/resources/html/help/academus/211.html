<STRONG>The Navigation Channel</STRONG>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Navigation Channel allows Collaborative Groupware users to access administrative functionality and access content for specific offerings. It contains three main sections - <B>Administration</B>, <B>Offering Subscription</B>, and <B>My Offerings</B>.</P>

<P align=left><SPAN class=contenttitle><STRONG>Administration</STRONG></SPAN><BR></P>
<P>The <B>Administration</B> link reveals a number of channels related to the management of user accounts, roles and permissions, topics, offerings, and importing capabilities. A user without admin permissions may be permitted to change their password and email address here, but the remainder of functionality will likely be reserved for users with administrative duties.</P>
<P>The channels offered from the Administration link within the Navigation channel include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Role Administration </LI>
<LI>Import Channel </LI>
<LI>User Administration </LI>
<LI>Topic Administration </LI>
<LI>Offering Administration</LI></UL>

<P>The <B>Offering Subscription</B> link leads to the <B>Offering Subscription Channel</B>, where a user can search for offerings by Topic Name, Offering Name, or Offering ID. Once the search returns a list of the available offerings, the user can pursue the enrollment process.</P>

<P align=left><STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>My Offerings</SPAN><BR></STRONG></P>
<P>The <B>My Offerings </B>link is only visible to users who are enrolled in and/or sponsors of at least one offering. If a user is not enrolled in any offerings, the link will not show up in the Navigation channel.</P>
