<P>The Briefcase Portlet allows individuals to maintain a personal set of folders and files. It also provides portfolio capabilities by allowing a user to share folders and their contents with other portal users.</P>
<P>Upon viewing the Briefcase Portlet for the first time, you will see the welcome screen from the image below. At this point, you need to decide which of your folders you want to view. Choose either <B>Personal</B>, <B>Personal LDAP Folders, Shared</B>, or <B>Network</B> folders. The options enabled may vary for your institution.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Once you enter the briefcase, the <B>Personal Folders</B> screen can be broken up into two parts. On the left is the folder navigation, and on the right are the contents within the selected folder.

If someone has already <B>Shared Folders</B> with you, or if you have <B>Peronal LDAP Folders</B> or <B>Network Folders</B> already enabled, those will be listed beneath your <B>Personal Folders</B>.</P>
