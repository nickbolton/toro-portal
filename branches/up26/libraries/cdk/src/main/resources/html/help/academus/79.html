<STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>Setting Permissions for Specific Offering&nbsp;Users</SPAN><BR></STRONG>
<P>To edit the permissions for specific users, you must start from the Main Roster view. If necessary, use the navigation tools to find a specific user in this offering. When they appear on the Roster List, click on the <B>Edit</B> icon under the "Type" column next to their name.</P>
<P>The <B>Edit Role</B> page will now appear. Note that this page applies to a specific user (Student ID) rather than an entire Role type. Check the boxes for the features this user should be allowed to do. Uncheck the boxes for features this user should be restricted from performing. </P>
<P>Once you have made all the necessary changes, click the "Update" button at the bottom. Or, click "Cancel" to return to the Roster without making any changes.</P>
<P>Once you return to the main view of users, the altered set of permissions will now be displayed as "user defined = ID."</P>
