<STRONG>The Offering Calendar</STRONG>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Calendar channel located within the Groupware Tab is a calendar dedicated to the specific offering. The current offering is always highlighted in the Navigation Channel. This channel is for offering sponsors to list important events for users within the offering. Users generally cannot add or edit events in this calendar; however, they can link to these events from within their own personal calendar channel outside the Collaborative Groupware.</P>
<P>The default view displays the current month, which allows the user to navigate between months or to a particular date. Selecting a date opens the event view for that date from which the user can view events, add/edit or delete events (if permissions apply). The left side of the channel shows the current month. To view a different month, use the arrow icon next to the month navigate to previous or future months.</P>
