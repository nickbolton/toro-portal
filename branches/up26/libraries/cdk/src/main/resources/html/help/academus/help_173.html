<STRONG>View All Active Offerings : Managing Offerings</STRONG>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>Offering States</SPAN><BR></STRONG></P>
<P>There are two types of <B>Offerings</B>, active and inactive. When an Offering is created, it is considered <B>Active</B>. When an <B>Active</B> Offering is deleted, its status becomes <B>Inactive</B>. Most people cannot view <B>Inactive</B> Offerings. This is a tidy way of storing unused Offerings for future use, without them cluttering up the Active Offerings list. This feature also allows sponsors to continue to have access to an offering after the conclusion of a term, while removing the offering from the students' or members' view.</P>

<P>To view <B>Active Offerings </B>a user has two options. Users with proper privileges can view all offerings by searching within the <B>Offering Administration</B> channel. The Offering Subscription channel also allows users to view offerings with Open and Request/Approve enrollment types. To view offerings within the <B>Offering Subscription</B> channel, follow these steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>From the <B>Navigation</B> channel, click the <B>Offering Subscription</B> link. </LI>
<LI>Enter search criteria for the offerings you wish to view, or leave all fields blank to view all offerings. </LI>
<LI>Click <B>Search</B>, you will now see as many Offerings as you have set for each page. </LI>
<LI>To more offerings on one page, locate the <B>Per Page</B> drop-down menu, and select the desired number. </LI>
<LI>Now click the Edit icon next to this menu. </LI>
<LI>You should now see all Offerings on one page.</LI></OL>

<OL>

<LI>Enter an Offering <B>Name</B> and a short <B>Description</B> in the text fields. </LI>
<LI>Select a <B>User Enrollment Model</B> based upon the way users can be enrolled. <B>Open Enrollment</B> is open for any users to enroll. <B>Request/Approve</B> enrollment requires the user to get approval from the Offering Sponsor before they will be enrolled. In the <B>Facilitator</B> model, users can only be enrolled by the Offering Sponsor or a system administrator; they don't have the means to request enrollment. An enrollment model of <B>SIS</B> is used for integrations with third party Student Administration Systems. </LI>
<LI>Select an <B>Enrolled User Default Type</B> from the drop-down list. </LI>
<LI>Enter any additional details about the offering such as Offering ID, Term, Start Date, End Date, Meeting Days, Meeting Times, and Location. </LI>
