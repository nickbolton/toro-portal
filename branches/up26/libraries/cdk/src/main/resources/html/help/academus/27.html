<STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>What are Gradebook Column Weights?</SPAN><BR></STRONG>
<P>Gradebook Weights are a way to place a greater importance on one or more assignments or exams over others within a single offering. For example, imagine that you created 8 exams in your offering, each with a maximum score of 100. Later, you decided that because Exam #4 was the midterm, it should be worth twice as much. At this point it would be very complicated to go back and change the maximum score to 200 for this column, as well as doubling each user's results. With <B>Column Weights</B>, all you have to do is double the weight value for this column. The Gradebook automatically adjusts each user's final grade for the offering.</P>
