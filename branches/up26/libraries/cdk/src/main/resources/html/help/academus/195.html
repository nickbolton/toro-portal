<P>The Folder view allows the user to create, edit, and manipulate file folders. The system contains various default file folders (e.g., in-box, drafts, sent mail, trash). In addition, the user can setup a variety of other folders that can be used to categorize their e-mail messages.</P>
<P>The folder view will display all of the folders and the number of read and unread messages they contain. By clicking on a folder, you will be brought into a focused folder view of the e-mail messages within that folder (similar to the in-box view).</P>
