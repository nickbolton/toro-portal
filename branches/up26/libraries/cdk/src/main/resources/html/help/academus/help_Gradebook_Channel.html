<P>At the beginning of offering creation, instructors will want to set up their gradebooks. The first thing to do is to add columns to the gradebook. The screenshot above shows a gradebook with no columns added.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="screenshots/gradebook_channel_25.GIF"></P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=contenttitle><STRONG>Adding a Column</STRONG></SPAN><BR></P>
<P>To add a column, first locate the <B>Gradebook</B> channel, then follow these steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Click the <B>Add Column </B>icon at the top of the channel. </LI>
<LI>If this column will be associated with an exam, select the exam from the <B>Assessment Association</B> drop-down menu. If there is no drop-down menu, then there are no assessments (exams) available for selection. </LI>
<LI>Type the name of the column in the <B>Column Name</B> field. This name will appear vertically above the column, so it should be something that distinguishes this column from any other, perhaps the name of a specific exam or assignment (i.e. "Tropical Weather Exam" or "Rain Cloud Assignment"). </LI>
<LI>For the <B>Make Feedback Visible</B> row, click <B>Yes</B> if you would like the users to be able to view feedback after the column is graded. Click <B>No</B> if you do not want any feedback delivered to users. </LI>
<LI>Determine a <B>Maximum Score</B> for this column and enter it in the text field. The maximum score is the best possible score a user can obtain. </LI>
<LI>Determine a <B>Column Weight</B> for this column. The column weight is a way to place greater importance on one column over others. You can read more about column weights in the <B>Edit All Gradebook Column Weights</B> lesson of this unit. </LI>
<LI>The <B>Position</B> pull-down menu allows you to place your column anywhere you desire. The first column will always be placed "At Beginning," but any additional columns can be placed before or after this point. </LI>
<LI>When all selections have been made, simply click the <B>Submit</B> button. (The <B>Submit and Activate</B> button will be explained later, as a part of the <B>Activate an Assignment</B> lesson of this unit.) </LI>
<LI>You will now see the gradebook with your new column as placed.</LI></OL>

<P>Activation is simply the process by which assignments and assessments are made available to users in the offering. Once the sponsor (or instructor) activates an assignment, enrolled users can access and work on it. When users are finished with the assignment, they can submit it back to the sponsor for grading.This also applies to exams. The sponsor must first activate an exam before the enrolled users can take it and submit it for grading.</P>

<LI>The <B>Column Name</B> cannot be changed here, but you should take note of it to verify that you are activating the correct column. </LI>
<LI>For the <B>Activation Link</B> row, you should select <B>No File to Link </B>if there is not a file or online resource to associated to the assignment, select <B>Link to URL</B> if this activation is already located online.

<LI>The <B>Activation Period</B> section allows you to set the dates and times when users can begin accessing this assignment or exam. You must also set the end dates and times (or deadline) when users will no longer be able to access the assignment or exam. </LI>
<LI>The <B>Activation For</B> section allows you to activate this column for the all enrolled users, or only for a select few. If you only want to activate this column for two or three people, click on the first person's name, then hold the CTRL button down while selecting additional users. </LI>
<LI>If you want users to be able to submit multiple attempts at this assignment or exam, enter the total number of attempts you want to allow in the <B>Attempts Permitted </B>field. </LI>

<P align=left>Immediately beneath the list of enrolled users, you will see a <B>Mean</B> score and a <B>Median</B> score.</P>
<P>The <B>Mean</B> score is the average of all users' scores. This figure is the sum of all scores divided by the number of users with a score. If a user does not have a score, they are not computed in with the mean score for the class.</P>
<P>The <B>Median</B> score is figured by taking the middle score of all users with a score. The user with this score will have equal numbers of users who scored better and users who scored worse. This score is usually not the same as the <B>Mean</B> score.</P>

<STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>What are Gradebook Column Weights?</SPAN><BR></STRONG>
<P>Gradebook Weights are a way to place a greater importance on one or more assignments or exams over others within a single offering. For example, imagine that you created 8 exams in your offering, each with a maximum score of 100. Later, you decided that because Exam #4 was the midterm, it should be worth twice as much. At this point it would be very complicated to go back and change the maximum score to 200 for this column, as well as doubling each user's results. With <B>Column Weights</B>, all you have to do is double the weight value for this column. The Gradebook automatically adjusts each user's final grade for the offering.</P>

    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="notetext">

            <td valign="top">

            <td width="100%" align="left">
                If you have set all of your column weight values to zero, your final grades will not be calculated.

<STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>How Do Column Weights Affect the Final Grade?</SPAN><BR></STRONG>

<P><IMG src="screenshots/gradebook_channel_4.gif"></P>
<P>
<TABLE width="100%" border=0>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Here it is in clearer language. First, you multiply a user's Score in the first column by the Weight assigned to that column. Repeat this for all columns. Then add all of those products together and call this number X. Now, find the Maximum Possible Score in the first column and multiply it by the Weight assigned to that column. Repeat this for all columns. Then add all of those products together and call this number Y. Finally, divide X by Y to get the user's Grade in the offering.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<LI>You will now see an editable list of all <B>Column Weights</B>. </LI>
<LI>Change the <B>Column Weights</B> as you desire. Remember, a higher weight amount in a column will put a greater importance on that column when the final grade is computed. When you are satisfied with all of your changes, click the <B>Submit</B> button.</LI></OL>

<STRONG>Edit All Gradebook Scores</STRONG><BR>

<OL type=1>
<LI>Locate the gradebook and click the <B>Edit</B> icon at the top of the channel next to the <B>Scores</B> link. </LI>

<STRONG>Exporting the Gradebook</STRONG>

<P>The time may come when you want to export the Gradebook from Academus into an external program (such as a spreadsheet). Academus can help you export the gradebook information into a pipe-delimited text file. This means that every cell within the table will be separated by the pipe "|" character. Each row will be separated by a carriage return. </P>
<P>If you would like to export the gradebook in this manner, simply follow these steps:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="screenshots/gradebook_channel_1.gif"></P>
<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>
<OL type=1>
<LI>Locate the <B>Gradebook</B> channel and click the <B>Export</B> icon at the top of the channel next to the <B>Scores</B> link. </LI>
<LI>A new window will open, showing the name of the export text file. You will also be prompted to save this file on your computer. </LI>
<LI>Select a location on your computer and save the file. </LI>
<LI>Once you save it, the new window will close itself. </LI>
<LI>You now have the gradebook in .txt format. </LI>
<LI>Follow the instructions within any external program (such as Excel) for importing a text file. Remember that this table is "pipe-delimited."</LI></OL>
