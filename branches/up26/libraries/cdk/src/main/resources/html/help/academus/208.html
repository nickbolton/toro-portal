<STRONG>Role Administration : System Level and Offering Level</STRONG>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Groupware has two levels of user-defined roles: System Level and Offering Level. These roles are defined within the Role Administration channel found under the Administration link. </P>
<P>In most cases, the System Administrator facilitates the creation/editing of roles. However, the permission for this activity is completely flexible and can be allocated to any role by the System Administrator. </P>
<P>The Role Administration Channel also facilitates the setup and editing of permissions at the System and default Offering level. This information will be covered in the next lesson: Permissions and Security.</P>

<P align=left>A System Level Role corresponds to the role that users are assigned as they are added into the system. This role will impact the permissions that users will have within the Administration section of the Groupware. The following channels have permissions set through System level roles:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Import Channel </LI>
<LI>Navigation Channel </LI>
<LI>Offering Administration Channel </LI>
<LI>Role Administration Channel </LI>
<LI>Topic Administration Channel </LI>
<LI>User Administration Channel</LI></UL>
<P>In most cases, general users will have very limited permissions associated with the Administrative functions.</P>

<P>Offerings can be compared to the classes in a learning context or groups of like minded individuals. Users must be enrolled into offerings in order to take part in the course or group "offered" by an institution. An Offering Level Role corresponds to the role that users will play within an offering (e.g., student, instructor, member, observer). There are no limits to the number or types of roles that can be created at the offering level. The Offering Level Role will define all of the permissions that a role has within an offering. The following channels will have permissions set within the Offering level role:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Announcements </LI>
<LI>Calendar </LI>
<LI>Chat </LI>
<LI>Folders </LI>
