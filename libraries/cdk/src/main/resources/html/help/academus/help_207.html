<STRONG>Role Permissions : Robust and Flexible</STRONG>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The groupware system within Academus has an extremely flexible and robust set of permissions. As discussed in the previous lesson, the administrator can setup a variety of roles. The permissions surrounding these roles can be set at 4 different levels: 1) System level role permissions, 2) Offering level default role permissions, 3) Offering level customized role permissions, 4) Offering Level customized individual permissions.</P>

<P align=left><STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>System Level Role Permissions</SPAN><BR></STRONG></P>
<P>The administrator will set the System level permissions within the Role Administration Channel. This process was explained during the Roles Administration lesson. These permissions primarily correspond to the Administrative features of the Groupware channels (e.g., Add Offerings, Add Roles, Add Users, etc.) and will be allocated to administrative users only. The one permission at this level that may be available to all users is the "Change Password / Change email" option. </P>
<P>These System level permissions can be altered by anyone with the correct permissions at any time. Any changes to permissions will take effect the next time a user logs into the system.</P>

<P>Within the Role Administration Channel, the Administrator will also setup the default permissions for roles within offerings. These permissions correspond to the various channels that exist within an offering (e.g., Chat, Discussion Forums, Gradebook, etc.). When a user is enrolled into an offering, they will be assigned a role. The permissions set by the Offering Permissions option will set the defaults for all individuals in these roles as they are enrolled into the offering.</P>
<P>These defaults can also be viewed within the Roster Channel. A drop-down box labeled <B>Types</B> can be found at the top of the roster channel. Simply pick a role from this box, and click the <B>Edit</B> icon. This will list all of the permissions for the associated role within the current offering. This process is detailed specifically within the Roster Channel unit of this course.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<P>Even though the administrator of the system has created a default set of permissions for various roles, these can be overwritten within an offering. For example, the "Sponsor" of a particular offering may want to grant all of the "Assistants" within his/her offering the ability to add announcements.</P>
<P>The manipulation of role-based permissions within an offering is facilitated through the <B>Roster</B> Channel. This capability is explained later in this course.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
