<STRONG>Searching and Importing Contacts</STRONG>

<P>The search functionality is very similar to that provided within both the Briefcase and Calendar channels. Based on the search criteria, a list of users will be returned. You can choose to add an entry to your address book from the list of portal entries returned, edit an existing entry or delete an existing entry from this view.</P>

<LI>Last Name </LI>
<LI>E-mail Address </LI>

<P>When importing, the system will prompt you to map the fields contained in your input file to the fields supported in the Academus Address Book. For example, if your input file stores the contact's "Mobile" phone number in a field called "Cell Phone"; select "Cell Phone" from the drop down box next to Mobile Phone to map these fields in the import process.</P>
<P>Click <B>OK</B> when mappings have been verified to initiate the import process.</P>
