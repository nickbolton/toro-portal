<STRONG>Group Chat Channel</STRONG>
<P>The Group Chat channel allows users from the Portal community to gather for a real-time chat experience. This takes place inside a virtual chat room, which is launched as a separate window from the Group Chat channel.</P>
<P>Chat rooms are enabled for specific groups of users from within the <B>Group Chat Admin</B> channel. Administrators of the portal community usually perform this task.</P>
<P><STRONG>Searching for a Chat Room</STRONG></P>
<P>In order for a user to join a chat room, a user must first locate a chat room that has been enabled for them. If no chat rooms are currently enabled for a particular user, their Group Chat channel will look like this:</P>

<P>If a chat room has been enabled for a user, it will show up in the Group Chat channel upon initial log in. If a chat room becomes enabled while a user is logged in, the user will need to click the <B>Search</B> button to refresh their available chat room list. A user can have more than one chat room available to them at any given time.</P>
