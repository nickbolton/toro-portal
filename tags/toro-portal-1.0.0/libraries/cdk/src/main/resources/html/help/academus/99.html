<STRONG>Using Forums</STRONG>
<P>
<P>The <B>Discussion Forums Channel</B> is a forum for the users associated with the current offering. A discussion board (known also by various other names such as discussion group, discussion forum, message board, and online forum) is a general term for any online "bulletin board" where you can leave and expect to see responses to messages you have left.</P>
<P>The Forums Channel consists of two main elements: Topics and Messages. All messages must be posted within a topic. Therefore, topics serve as a means to group messages by a certain subject.</P>

<P>To create a topic, simply follow these steps:</P>

<LI>Click the <B>Add</B> icon at the top of the channel. </LI>
<LI>Enter the name of this particular forum <B>Topic</B>. </LI>
<LI>Click the <B>OK</B> button. </LI>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="screenshots/forums_channel_2.gif"></P>
<P>Topics can be edited or deleted at any time by users who have appropriate permissions. To do so, first click the <B>Show Forum Topics</B> link in the default channel view. Next, locate the desired forum topic and click on the <B>Edit</B> or <B>Delete</B> icon, respectively. Keep in mind that deleting a Topic will also delete all messages within that topic.</P>
