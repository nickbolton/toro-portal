<P><STRONG><SPAN class=contenttitle>What is a Gradebook Column?</SPAN><BR></P></STRONG>
<P>In the heart of the Gradebook channel, you will see a matrix of columns and rows. Each row represents a user who is enrolled in the current offering. The columns, however, represent exams or assignments that have been created for this offering. Through the duration of a course offering, a user's results on any number of exams or assignments will be tabulated to determine that user's comprehension of the materials.</P><STRONG>

<P>At the beginning of offering creation, instructors will want to set up their gradebooks. The first thing to do is to add columns to the gradebook. The screenshot above shows a gradebook with no columns added.</P>

<P align=left><SPAN class=contenttitle><STRONG>Adding a Column</STRONG></SPAN><BR></P>
<P>To add a column, first locate the <B>Gradebook</B> channel, then follow these steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Click the <B>Add Column </B>icon at the top of the channel. </LI>
<LI>If this column will be associated with an exam, select the exam from the <B>Assessment Association</B> drop-down menu. If there is no drop-down menu, then there are no assessments (exams) available for selection. </LI>
<LI>Type the name of the column in the <B>Column Name</B> field. This name will appear vertically above the column, so it should be something that distinguishes this column from any other, perhaps the name of a specific exam or assignment (i.e. "Tropical Weather Exam" or "Rain Cloud Assignment"). </LI>
<LI>For the <B>Make Feedback Visible</B> row, click <B>Yes</B> if you would like the users to be able to view feedback after the column is graded. Click <B>No</B> if you do not want any feedback delivered to users. </LI>
<LI>Determine a <B>Maximum Score</B> for this column and enter it in the text field. The maximum score is the best possible score a user can obtain. </LI>
<LI>Determine a <B>Column Weight</B> for this column. The column weight is a way to place greater importance on one column over others. You can read more about column weights in the <B>Edit All Gradebook Column Weights</B> lesson of this unit. </LI>
<LI>The <B>Position</B> pull-down menu allows you to place your column anywhere you desire. The first column will always be placed "At Beginning," but any additional columns can be placed before or after this point. </LI>
<LI>When all selections have been made, simply click the <B>Submit</B> button. (The <B>Submit and Activate</B> button will be explained later, as a part of the <B>Activate an Assignment</B> lesson of this unit.) </LI>
<LI>You will now see the gradebook with your new column as placed.</LI></OL>
