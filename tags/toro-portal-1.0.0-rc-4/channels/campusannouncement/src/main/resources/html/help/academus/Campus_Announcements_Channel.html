The Campus Announcements Channel allows users with proper privileges to publish announcements. Portal users who have access to the channel and the group(s) associated with the announcement can view these announcements. The channel also supports the ability to view a composite list of announcements, which includes all of the announcements created for the offerings in which that user is enrolled, if the institution is using the Academus Collaborative Groupware.
