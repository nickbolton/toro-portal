<TD>
<P>Here it is in clearer language. First, you multiply a user's Score in the first column by the Weight assigned to that column. Repeat this for all columns. Then add all of those products together and call this number X. Now, find the Maximum Possible Score in the first column and multiply it by the Weight assigned to that column. Repeat this for all columns. Then add all of those products together and call this number Y. Finally, divide X by Y to get the user's Grade in the offering.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<OL>
<LI>Locate the gradebook and click the <B>Weighting</B> link (or the <B>Edit</B> icon next to it) at the top of the channel. </LI>
<LI>You will now see an editable list of all <B>Column Weights</B>. </LI>
<LI>Change the <B>Column Weights</B> as you desire. Remember, a higher weight amount in a column will put a greater importance on that column when the final grade is computed. When you are satisfied with all of your changes, click the <B>Submit</B> button.</LI></OL>
