This page describes how to build and deploy the components in Toro Portal.

  # Check out the desired version. For the trunk, svn checkout https://toro-portal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ toro-portal --username username
  # Perform an initial maven install from the root directory. (mvn install)
  # Use the installer to initially deploy all the components and initialize the database. (See [http://www.unicon.net/node/821])
  # Copy the ant.installer.properties file to the root directory as build.properties.
  # Modify source code or resources, then deploy that component. The ant script at the root directory handles deploying all the subcomponents. Type 'ant' at the root directory to get a list of all the available targets.
  # Restart tomcat
