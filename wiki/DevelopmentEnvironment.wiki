This page describes how to build and deploy the components in Toro Portal.

# Check out the desired version. For the trunk, svn checkout https://toro-portal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ toro-portal --username username

# Perform an initial maven install from the root directory.
toro-portal> mvn install

# Use the installer to initially deploy all the components and initialize the database.
(See [http://www.unicon.net/node/821])

# Modify source code or resources, then deploy that component. The ant script at the root directory handles deploying all the subcomponents. Type 'ant' at the root directory to get a list of all the available targets.

e.g.

toro-portal> vi channels/channels/survey/src/main/java/net/unicon/portal/channels/survey/survey/CSurvey.java

toro-portal> ant survey
